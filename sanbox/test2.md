Python 3 syntax is supported.

Unlike other languages, Python uses indentation for separation, which makes it particularly difficult and error-prone to use regular expressions to extract functions or class. So I used the dt-python-parser to make an ast for the code, so as to get the full expression of the function or class accurately.
