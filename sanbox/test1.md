This plugin is based on dt-python-parser to develop a tool for arbitrarily removing functions or classes in python code. Although there are a lot of excellent plugins to support Python development, it is strange that there is no tool that can delete a function or a class at will. When I started to solve this problem myself, I found that the hardest part was actually how to parse Python.

* Highlight the name of the class you want to delete in code, and press CTL+F5 to delete the entire class

* Highlight the name of the function/class you want to dumplicate in code, and press CTL+F6 to duplicate the entire function/class
